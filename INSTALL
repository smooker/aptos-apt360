the install of apt360 works in the usual fashion of the GNU autotools:
type: 

./configure
make
make install 

if you are not familiar with the GNU autotools, be aware that many more
options exist. 

Also used for the some math issues in the TABCYL command is the Gnu 
scientific library gsl. The program will compile without it, and the TABCYL
command will often work ok, but be aware of the problem. The command will
fail with an error message if the gsl library is required for a TABCYL 
definition.

There is currently no support for 64 bit machines.  Until I get a 64 bit 
machine, or someone offers to patch the code, you may have issues running
it.

If you are compiling on a bigendian machine (e.g., Mac OSX, Solaris sparc,etc.)
the code will not work. Since the code was originally for the bigendian 
OS/360 machine, the conversion to bigendian will only require the writing 
of one file (ADFPRL.ASM.S) and undefining some macros.  If the demand is 
there, I will try to work on this.  

To generate the final post from the cl-file that apt creates, you will
need a post-processor. Postp, from the same site as this package, is being 
developed for this purpose.  It works hand-in-hand with the apt360 package,
and generates the final g-code.  You will definitely need this package to
use it in your machine. 

You will want some way of viewing your geometry. Sean Dolan's vapt project
has been developed for this purpose.  Get it at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/vapt/

I also have a copy at the aptos site for convenience.
 
I've also included a vim syntax file in the /vim directory.  If you use vim, 
you may want to install these files in your ~/.vim directory.

Installing f2c:

f2c is now part of the distribution and should compile and link while building
the rest of the program.
