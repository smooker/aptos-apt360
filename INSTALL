the install of apt360 works in the usual fashion of the GNU autotools:
type: 

./configure
make
make install 

if you are not familiar with the GNU autotools, be aware that many more
options exist. 

You will need the libraries for f2c to compile.  F2c is a C program that was
used to convert the Fortran H code to C.  The resulting C code makes calls to 
the f2c library.  You don't need to use f2c the program, but you will need 
the library.  Your distribution may include it or it may be an option.  
If not, you can get the f2c library at: 

http://www.netlib.org/f2c/libf2c.zip

It is probably available from your distro's website also.

Also used for the some math issues in the TABCYL command is the Gnu 
scientific library gsl. The program will compile without it, and the TABCYL
command will often work ok, but be aware of the problem. 

If you are compiling on a bigendian machine (e.g., Mac OSX, Solaris sparc,etc.)
the code will not work. Since the code was originally for the bigendian 
OS/360 machine, the conversion to bigendian will only require the writing 
of one file (ADFPRL.ASM.S) and undefining some macros.  If the demand is 
there, I will try to work on this.  

To generate the final post from the cl-file that apt creates, you will
need a post-processor. Postp, from the same site as this package, is being 
developed for this purpose.  

You will want some way of viewing your geometry.  The postp post-processor 
includes a dxf post-processor that I have been using to view geometry in 
dxf format.  Two good, open-source packages I have been using are QCad 
and Blender.

I've also included a vim syntax file in the /vim directory.  If you use vim, 
you may want to install these files in your ~/.vim directory.
