Apt is an acronym for Automatically Programmed Tools.  It is a special-purpose 
language created to run automatically controlled machine tools such as 
milling machines and lathes.

Apt360 is a port of the IBM's Apt program from  the 60's
that ran on the s/360.  Expect to see some antique characteristics from that era, such
as no dynamic memory ,and frequent references to "CARDS" and "TAPE".

You will need the libraries for f2c to compile.  F2c is a C program that was
used to convert the Fortran H code to C.  The resulting C code makes calls to the f2c 
library.  You don't need to use f2c the program, but you will need the library.  Your
distribution may include it or it may be an option.  If not, you can get the f2c 
library at: 

http://www.netlib.org/f2c/libf2c.zip

It is probably available from your distro's website also.


In addition to f2c, you will also probably want the Qcad dxf library.  The program 
will compile without it, but you will not be able to view the geometry you create.
Two very good programs I have been using for viewing dxf's are Qcad and Blender.
