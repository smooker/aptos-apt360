Apt is an acronym for Automatically Programmed Tools.  It is a special-purpose 
language created to run automatically controlled machine tools such as 
milling machines and lathes.

Apt360 is a port of IBM's Apt program from  the 60's that ran on the s/360. 
References from that era, such as "CARDS" and "TAPE" abound in the code.

Apt is considered by many to be obsolete, but it still is good for many tasks 
a machinist does daily that are not handled easily by modern graphical systems.
These include family of parts programs, math-oriented geometry, and 4 and 5 
axis contouring.

As far as I know, the original source code in Fortran that is included in 
this package was made public domain by IBM many years ago.  As such, that 
portion of the present package is available for any purpose whatsoever.  
The c code however, is made available with the GNU GPL.
