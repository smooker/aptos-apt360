<h1 align="center">A Simple Tutorial</h1>

<p>
This tutorial assumes that you have a working installation of apt360, plus
the postprocessor postp with dxf capability.
In this tutorial, we will make this <A href="images/samplePart.png" >sample part</A> using 
Apt. The finished program can be found <a href=samplePart.apt.html>here.</a>
A list of the final machine code can be found <a href="samplePart.tap.html">here.</a>

</p>
<h2>Minimal Apt Program</h2>
A minimal Apt program consists of the keyword PARTNO, which always starts
the program, and the keyword FINI, which ends it.
<pre>
partno sample part
fini
</pre>
Apt is not sensitive to case, so "PARTNO" or "Partno" are equivalent to "partno".  
One Fortran-like restriction with apt360 on PARTNO is the word must begin in the 
first column.  Most apt360 words are free-format, and indentation should be
used when necessary to make the program more readable.
<h2>Some Preliminary Statements</h2>
Next we will add the following statements:
<pre>
clprnt
machin/dxf
machin/pmill
print/on
</pre>
Clprnt prints a readable copy of the CL file to the screen, useful for debugging.
The "machin" statements are for postprocessors. After the CL file is generated, the 
postprocessors specified as arguments to the machin statements are called and the
CL file is processed accordingly.  The dxf and pmill postprocessors generate a 
dxf file and a gcode file respectively. The "print/on" will also print geometric
definitions in canonical form. In addition, if the dxf post is specified, the 
geometric definitions will be placed in the dxf file.
<h2>Variables</h2>
I like to specify print dimensions early on so that if the print dimensions 
change, the variables only have to be changed in one place:
<pre>
d1=2 $$height
d2=3 $$length
d3=.25$$corner rad
d4=12 $$number of holes in hole pattern
d5=1.1246 $$y value of corner cut
d6=131 $$corner cut angle
</pre>
A user defined identifier can be any combination of letters and numbers up to 6 letters as long
as the name is not a reserved keyword, such as "partno", or "fini".  A name must have at least
one letter. With over 300 keywords, it is difficult to avoid name clashes.  A safe workaround 
is to include at least one number in a name, although in apt360 at least, there are a few keywords 
with numeric characters.  The characters following the "$$" are comments and are ignored
by the program.
<h2>Geometry</h2>
The following lines specify the entities that will be used in defining the cutter path.
<pre>
lx=line/xaxis
ly=line/yaxis
l1=line/parlel,lx,ylarge,d1
l2=line/parlel,ly,xlarge,d2
l3=line/(point/d2,d5),atangl,(360-d6),l2
l4=line/parlel,ly,xsmall,.4

c1=circle/xlarge,ly,ylarge,lx,radius,d3
c2=circle/xlarge,ly,ysmall,l1,radius,d3
c3=circle/xsmall,l2,ylarge,lx,radius,d3
p1=point/xlarge,intof,lx,c1
</pre>

Note that lines and circles are named for use in other definitions. In addition, notice
that named constants can be used in place of hard numbers.  Apt includes many other 
geometric <a href="surface_defs.html">definitions</a>.
<h2>Running a Preliminary Test</h2>
So far, we have a program that looks like <a href="tutorial1.html">this</a>.
Save this text file as "samplePart.apt", then, from a command line in the directory the file is
located, type
<pre> apt samplePart.apt</pre>
You should get output that looks like <a href="tutorial2.html">this</a>, and a file named
"cl.dxf" should exist in the same directory. If we open this file in Qcad, you should see
something resembling <a href="images/tutorial2.png">this</a>.  The red box around the 
geometry is a bounding box.  Because lines in apt are considered to be infinite in extent,
the bounding box is needed for rendering in a cad program.  You may want to consider this 
as the stock before machining. The size and placement of the box is specified in 
"postp/conf/dxf01.pst".
