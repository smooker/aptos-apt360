      The language that provides the macro capability consists of the MACRO
      and TERMAC statements, which define the bounds of the macro definition,
      and the CALL statement, which defines the location in the part program
      where the macro is to be executed.
    </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="macro_kw"></a>8.2.1. The Macro Definition Start (MACRO) Statement</h3></div></div></div><p>
        The macro definition start (MACRO) statement is used to indicate the
        beginning of a definition of a macro. The general format of this
        statement is:
        </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>SMAC = MACRO/ list</p></blockquote></div><p>
      </p><p>
        The statements that make up the macro being defined can now be
        referred to by the symbol SMAC.  The symbol used to name the macro
        is subject to the same restrictions that apply to any variable symbol
        (see <a href="language_and_syntax.html#symbols" title="1.1.4. Symbols">Section 1.1.4</a>). The definition of any macro variable
        appears in the list immediately following the slash in the MACRO
        statement. Macro variables and their methods of definition are
        discussed in <a href="macro_def.html#macro_var_defs" title="8.2.4. Definition of Macro Variables">Section 8.2.4</a>.
      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="termac_kw"></a>8.2.2. The Macro Definition End (TERMAC) Statement</h3></div></div></div><p>
        The TERMAC statement is used to indicate the conclusion of a macro
        definition. The TERMAC statement must be the only APT statement on
        the line.
      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="call_kw"></a>8.2.3. The Macro Execution (CALL) Statement</h3></div></div></div><p>
        The macro is executed by means of the CALL statement. The format for
        this statement is:
        </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>CALL/ NAME, list</p></blockquote></div><p>
      </p><p>
        This specifies that the macro defined and labeled NAME is to be
        executed at this time. Before this statement, all of the program
        bounded by the statements NAME = MACRO/ list and TERMAC was stored
        internally for later processing. When the CALL/ NAME, list statement
        is encountered, the macro is processed statement by statement exactly
        as it was originally defined. The process is repeated if later CALL/
        NAME, list statements occur in the part program.
      </p><p>
        Definition or redefinition of macro variables appears in the list
        immediately following the macro name in the CALL statement. Macro
        variables are discussed in the following section.
      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="macro_var_defs"></a>8.2.4. Definition of Macro Variables</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Macro variables permit communication between information defined in
        the basic part program and that which is contained in the macro. A
        macro variable is usually used so that a particular APT statement can
        be altered in later CALL statements.  For example, in the following
        statements, the symbols A, B, and C are macro variables:
        </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre class="programlisting">
$$
$$ Other APT Statements Here
$$
1) NAME = MACRO/ A, B, C
2) FEDRAT/ A
3) COOLNT/ B
4) GODLTA/ 0, 0, C
5) TERMAC
$$
$$ Other APT Statements Here
$$
ID1) CALL/ NAME, A=20, B=FLOOD, C=1
ID2) CALL/ NAME, A=50, B=MIST, C=1
ID3) CALL/ NAME, A=30, B=ON, C=5</pre></blockquote></div><p>
        The macro referred to as NAME would be stored as defined at statements
        1 through 5. The statement labeled as ID1 would produce the following
        result: Where A occurred in the macro, the value 20 Would be inserted;
        where B occurred, the vocabulary word FLOOD Would be used; and where
        C occurred, the value 1 Would be used. In effect, then, the result-
        ant statements would be:
        </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre class="programlisting">
FEDRAT/ 20
COOLNT/ FLOOD
GODLTA/ 0, 0, 1</pre></blockquote></div><p>
        In a similar fashion, the CALL statement labeled ID2 would result in:
        </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre class="programlisting">
FEDRAT/ 50
COOLNT/ MIST
GODLTA/ 0, 0, 1</pre></blockquote></div><p>
        and the CALL statement at ID3 would result in:
        </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre class="programlisting">
FEDRAT/ 30
COOLNT/ ON
GODLTA/ 0, 0, 5</pre></blockquote></div><p>
        A Macro variables can be used to represent other unsubscripted APT
        symbols, vocabulary words (except for the fixed-field Words and the
        word CALL), or numbers. They cannot be used to represent statement
        labels, subscripted symbols, or arithmetic expressions. A macro
        variable must satisfy the rules that apply to a variable symbol
        (see <a href="language_and_syntax.html#symbols" title="1.1.4. Symbols">Section 1.1.4</a>), with the exception that it can appear
        elsewhere in the same part program; that is, the same symbolic name
        can be used as a macro variable in more than one macro in the same
        part program; also, the same symbol can be used as a statement label
        or variable symbol external to macros that use it as a macro variable.
        A macro variable cannot be subscripted; to be used within the macro,
        each macro variable must be listed to the right of the slash in the
        MACRO statement.
      </p><p>
        The maximum number of macro variables for any given macro is 50.
      </p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="normal_values"></a>8.2.4.1. Normal Values</h4></div></div></div><p>
          A normal value for a macro variable is that value
          which is assigned to the variable at macro definition
          time (as listed to the right of the slash in the
          MACRO statement). If a normal value is not specified for a macro
          variable, a value must be assigned
          at each CALL statement for the macro in which the
          variable is used. Examples of macro variables
          and normal values appear below:
          </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre class="programlisting">
NAME1 = MACRO/ A, B, C, D
NAME2 = MACRO/ AA=2.3, BB=TLLFT, CC=X
NAME3 = MACRO/ E, F, G=4.5, H</pre></blockquote></div><p>
        </p><p>
          For the macro defined as NAME1, the four macro
          variables A, B, C, and D do not have a normal
          value assigned to them. Hence, a value must be
          given for each macro variable on the CALL statement that activates
          this macro.
        </p><p>
          The macro defined as NAME2 has normal values
          assigned to each of the macro variables AA, BB,
          CC. These Would be used at execution of the macro
          if no value was assigned in the CALL statement.
        </p><p>
          NAMES has a combination of macro variables
          with and without normal values. Values must be
          assigned at the CALL statement for macro variables
          E, F, and H; if no value was assigned for G, 4.5
          Would be used.
        </p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="assigned_values"></a>8.2.4.2. Assigned Values</h4></div></div></div><p>
          A macro variable may be assigned a value at execution time (that is,
          in the CALL statement) in the
          same manner as a normal value was assigned at
          definition time (on the MACRO statement). The
          names of the macro variables in the CALL statement
          must be the same as those used in the referenced
          macro; however, they need not be in the same
          order. The following example indicates the use of
          assigned values for macro variables:
          </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre class="programlisting">
CALL/ MAC2, D=1, E=OFF</pre></blockquote></div><p>
          The values of 1 and OFF are assigned to the macro
          variables D and E, respectively, in the execution of
          the macro NAME2. In this instance, it makes no
          difference whether any normal values were assigned
          for the macro variables D and E -- the values specified in the CALL
          statement take precedence. Only
          the macro variables for which an assigned value is
          specified may be referenced in the CALL statement.
        </p><p>
          The assigned values replace the normal values
          only for the CALL statement in which they appear;
          that is, the normal value is still in effect for future
          CALL commands.

        The sample loop shown in <a href="loops_macros.html#loop_construction" title="8.1.5. Constructing a Loop">Section 8.1.5</a> could be
        programmed using the macro capability as indicated

        The following rules must be observed when using
        the macro capability:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
            A macro definition cannot be nested within another macro
            definition; that is, two statements of
            the general form SMAC = MACRO/ list cannot be
            specified without an intervening TERMAC statement.
          </p></li><li><p>
            A macro variable must have a value assigned to
            it either as a normal value from the MACRO statement or by
            assigning a specific value in the CALL statement.
          </p></li><li><p>
            The following vocabulary words are not allowed in a macro
            definition: RESERV, SYN, FINI, LOOPST, and LOOPND.
          </p></li><li><p>
            A macro definition must occur in the part program before the
            CALL statement that references it.
          </p></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
          LOOPST and LOOPND are not permitted in a macro, since the macro
          definition mode itself permits all of the computing and looping
          logic (for example, IF, JUMPTO, etc.) inherent in the loop
          definition.
        </p></td></tr></table></div><p>
        In addition to the above rules, it is not desirable
        to specify those words within a macro which, by
        their very nature, are not repetitive; for example,
        CLPRNT, NOPOST, etc. The processor will not
        treat this condition as an error, but it will result
        in the needless execution of these statements over
        and over. Further, since a macro is handled in
        much the same manner as a loop, it is also advisable to keep the
        macro as small as possible, eliminating statements that could be
        specified without error outside the bounds of the macro.
      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="macro_loop_compute"></a>8.2.7. Looping and Computing within a Macro</h3></div></div></div><p>
        The following example indicates how looping, computing, and branching
        can all be used within the same macro. In this example, a given number
        of holes along a line will be drilled. The number of
        holes, the depth of each hole, and the feed rate are
        macro variables; they can thus be varied in the CALL statement.
        </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><div class="example"><a name="macro_loop_example"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 8.3. MACRO with Loop</b></p><pre class="programlisting">
    NAME = MACRO/ A, B, C, D, E, F
    N = 1
R1) GOTO/ A(N), D
    GODLTA/ 0, 0, -E, B

    N = N + 1
    IF(N - F) R1, R1, R2

                E=.5, F=30</pre></div></blockquote></div><p>
      </p><p>
        In this example assuming PT to be a previously
        defined array of points, the CALL statement would
        result in 30 holes being drilled at a depth of .5, with
        the following feed rates: 10 inches/minute (D) moving between holes,
        2 inches/minute (B) during the plunge movement, and 5 inches/minute
        (C) during the withdraw movement. By using another CALL
        statement and altering the parameters, the pattern
        can be located elsewhere and repeated.
      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="macro_nesting"></a>8.2.8. Nesting of Macros</h3></div></div></div><p>
        The APT language permits the nesting of macros by
        recognizing a CALL statement for one macro within
        the definition of another. For example, if the
        macro MACA had within its definition the statement
        CALL/ MACB, at execution of MACA (that is, when
        the CALL/ MACA, list statement is encountered),
        MACA would be executed up to the CALL/ MACB
        statement. The entire macro denoted by MACB
        would be executed at this time, and the rest of
        MACA, from the CALL/ MACB statement on, would
        then be executed.
      </p><p>
        The maximum level of nesting for macros is
        five; that is, the first macro can call a second
        macro, which can call a third, and so on until a
        fifth macro has been called. The fifth macro must
        then return control to the fourth called macro before
        another macro can be called.
