      Startup commands were introduced in <a href="startup.html" title="5.3. Startup Procedures">Section 5.3</a> and are
      used to
      position the cutter properly in one, two, or three surfaces.  The
      problem breaks up into two basic areas:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
          Determining the side of the surface on which the cutter is to be
        </p></li><li><p>
          Determining which of several possible final positions is to be
          selected when more than one exists
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      In <a href="startup.html" title="5.3. Startup Procedures">Section 5.3</a> it was pointed out that an undirected GO/
      statement
      would move the cutter to about the closest of all possible valid
      positions.  In <a href="spec_tech.html#spec_feats" title="14.1. Special Features">Section 14.1</a> an example was given in which
      the
      DNTCUT-CUT feature was used to make an interim move that positioned the
      cutter closer to the desired stopping position than to any other
      possible stopping place.  This can also be accomplished with an expanded
      form of INDIRV of INDIRP statements, in which more than one vector can
      be defined.  The format of these statements is:
    </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><div class="literallayout"><p>INDIRV/ [VDS] [, VPS] [, VCS]<br>
<br>
INDIRV/ [PDS] [, PPS] [, PCS]</p></div></blockquote></div><p>
      The vectors resulting from either of these statements are associated
      with the surfaces in the GO/ statement.  The first vector indicated is
      used with regard to the first surface in the startup command, the second
      is used for the second surface, etc.  There can be no more vectors
      specified in the INDIRV/ and (implicitly) in the INDIRP/ statements than
      there are surfaces in the associated startup command.
    </p><p>
      Any two of the three points or vectors may be omitted if commas are
      inserted to indicate the position where necessary.  For example:
    </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre class="programlisting">INDIRV/ V1, , V2
INDIRV/ , , V1
INDIRV/ V1</pre></blockquote></div><p>
      In the first example, V1 is used with the first surface, and V2 is used
      with the third surface specified in the startup command.  In the second
      example, V1 is used with the third surface, and in the last example, V1
      is used with the first surface.
    </p><p>
      The vectors or points may be specified explicitly by using the x,y, and
      z values, or may be represented by either a symbolic name or a nested
      definition.
    </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="indir_effect"></a>14.2.1. The Effect of INDIR Vectors</h3></div></div></div><p>
        When more than on INDIR vector is specified, the processor makes one
        intermediate movement of the cutter for each vector specified.  The
        intermediate movements are used only to position the tool locally for
        the next step and are not output(similar to a DNTCUT-CUT option).  The
        INDIR vector associated with the drive surface is used to pierce that
        surface, and the cutter is moved to the surface as follows:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
            If the cutter is to be ON the surface, the cutter is moved
            directly to the pierce point.
          </p></li><li><p>
            If the cutter is to offset, the pierce point is adjusted by the
            cutter radius in the direction of the INDIR vector.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        From the resultant point (pierce point for drive surface INDIR), the
        vector associated with the part surface is used to pierce that
        surface.  The point is adjusted, as noted above, for the drive surface
        to account for the offset condition, if appropriate.  If more than two
        INDIR vectors are specified, the process is repeated: from the pierce
        point on the part surface, the third INDIR vector is used to pierce
        the check surface, and the point is adjusted.  From the final adjusted
        pierce point, after all INDIR vectors have been processed, the
        processor executes an undirected startup to the surfaces involved.
      </p><p>
        If the INDIR vector does not pierce the associated surfaces, the
        processor proceeds as follows:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
            The processor computes the minimum distance to all the surfaces
            from the current tool location.
          </p></li><li><p>
            The processor moves the INDIR vector along an amount equal to the
            greatest of these distances.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        The exception to the above procedure occurs when a one-surface startup
        is used with a single INDIR vector.  If the vector does not pierce the
        surface, a plane parallel to the INDIR vector is established, and a
        two-surface startup is made to get the final position.
      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
          If the vector does not pierce the surface, the only possible
          stopping locations are TO and PAST; it is not possible to achieve
          the ON position.
        </p></td></tr></table></div><p>
        Should the INDIR vector miss the surface by a sufficient amount (that
        is, the closest distance it comes to the surface is greater than the
        cutter radius), an error condition exists. <a href="startup_cmds.html#figure118" title="Figure 14.12. INDIRV Usage">Figure 14.12</a>
        shows two
        usages of a one-surface startup with an INDIR vector.  An INDIR vector
        VA results in final cutter position PTC (the center of the cutter is
        on the given INDIR, and the required position of TO is satisfied).  A
        specification of VB for an INDIR gives PTB, even though the INDIR
        vector does not pierce the surface.  The same constraints have been
        satisfied; that is, the center of the cutter is on the given INDIR
        vector, and the positional modifier TO has been satisfied.

        are required to
        select the proper final position.  Note that the final position could
        have been achieved with a DNTCUT-CUT sequence, but the two INDIR
        vectors remove the necessity to use this method.  From the starting
        point PTA, the vector V1 is used to pierce the DS.  From the resulting
        location, the vector V2 is used to pierce the PS (resulting in the
        point P1).  From this last pierce point, a two-surface undirected
        startup is made, and the result is PTB.

        The GO/ statement is processed using an analytical method when certain
        conditions are met (as outlined in <a href="spec_tech.html#spec_feats" title="14.1. Special Features">Section 14.1</a>).
        Some special considerations apply to these cases, as follows:
      </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
          The motion to the drive surface is usually exactly a minimum
          possible movement if the GO/ is undirected.  If the part surface is
          not a horizontal plane, the resulting motion to the part surface
          will probably not be the minimum possible movement.  The motion to
          the drive surface is always exactly along a projection of the INDIR
          vector on the part surface if the GO/ is directed.  (This means that
          the cutter must be able to be positioned properly to the DS when
          moving along the INDIR vector; the motion is always forward along
          the INDIR vector.)

        <a href="startup_cmds.html#figure120" title="Figure 14.14. INDIRV Error Condition">Figure 14.14</a> shows a situation where the OFFSET/
        statement results in a final position in which the cutter is not
        positioned properly with regard to the 
        drive surface at the conclusion of the startup.  A height is always
        associated with the cutter, and , in the referenced figure, if the
        cutter is tall enough, it will still be in contact with the drive
        surface when movement along the tool axis to the part surface is
        complete.  However, if the height specified is not large enough, the
        final position may not be in contact with the drive surface.

        The positional modifiers TO and PAST have significance with regard to
        the current cutter-surface relationship (as pointed out before, TO
        indicates cutter side of the surface, and PAST indicates the opposite
        side).  There are instances where the cutter center may be ON the
        surface at the start of a set startup commands.  In this regard, TO
        and PAST are not defined, and the SRFVCT statement is required to
        define the desired final point properly.  The SRFVCT statement format
        is as follows:
      </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>SRFVCT/ [VDS,] [VPS,] [VCS]</p></blockquote></div><p>
        The vectors given in the SRFVCT/ statement refer to the associated
        surfaces in the startup command (that is, the first vector is used
        with the drive (first specified) surface, the second with the part
        surface, and the third with the check surface).  References to SRFVCT
        vectors may be omitted if commas are included to indicate position.
        No more vectors may be given than surfaces in the GO/ command.  The
        meaning of the SRFVCT is that the specified vector points from the
        acceptable TO position to the acceptable PAST position.
      </p><p>
        <a href="startup_cmds.html#figure121" title="Figure 14.15. SRFVCT Usage">Figure 14.15</a> shows the situation where the cutter is
        initially on PL1;
        therefore, the vector V1 is used to indicate that the TO position
        would be to the left of PL1 and PAST position to the right.
