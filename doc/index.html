<h2>Using Apt360</h2>
<p>
Apt360 consists of a binary file, 'apt360', and two scripts, 'apt' and 'callpost'.  The binary
simply reads from stdin.  To use it, you could use a command such as: 
<pre>apt360 &lt;somefile.apt</pre>
As 
a convenience, the script 'apt' allows a command line like: 
<pre>apt somefile_1.apt somefile_2.apt</pre>
This runs two consecutive files and sets some environment variables, but basically runs the 
previous command.  The "apt" script is the preferred way of running the program.  As of 1.0.0, 
there are no command options, although future versions undoubtedly will have some.  The apt360 binary is
hardwired to call a program named "callpost" which is used to execute a seperate postprocessing 
program.  
</p>
<h2>Vapt</h2>
<p>
Apt360 is language based, and it does not come with any means of viewing the geometry you create with
it.  This is a serious limitation, and Sean Dolan's <a href=https://sourceforge.net/projects/vapt/
	>vapt project </a> is a must-have for doing any serious work in apt.  Vapt reads the stdout of
apt360, parses it, and displays the geometry in 3-d, with an animated tool-path.  A typical use of 
the program would be: 
<pre>apt somefile.apt|vapt</pre>
The stdout of apt360 is read by vapt, and a geometry
representation is created, with the ability to zoom, rotate and scale.

<h2>Learning Apt</h2>
<p>
Apt is a large and powerful language, and giving a detailed treatment of it would require
writing a fairly good sized textbook.  Rather than try to create a introduction to Apt that
would be far too brief and incomplete, I would like to point you in the direction of some of the 
resources I have used in learning Apt.
</p>
<p>
Probably the best resource I have found is the book <cite>Numerical Control Programming in Apt</cite>
by Irvin H. Kral.  It covers Apt in great detail, has numerous examples, and the version of Apt used
in the book, Apt-AC, is very similar to Apt360. With the exception of some surface definitions and 
a few advanced features, the two programs are nearly identical.  Most of the examples, with the exception of
the polyconic surfaces, should work with minor tweaking, and in fact, many of us have used the examples to
verify that apt360 was working properly.  This is a good sized textbook, at almost 500 pages. Unfortunately,
the book is out of print,  although you can get some copies
off of Amazon.com and Barnes and Noble.

<p>
With the source code is an example directory with several sample programs that you can look at to get 
an idea of what can be done with the program.

<h3>#cam</h3>
<p>
Many of us with interest in this cam system have taken to communicating with one another on the irc.freenode.net
channel #cam.  If you have an issue or question, you can often find one of us who can answer a question for you.

<h3>Sourceforge</h3>
<p>
Sourceforge, the host of this program and vapt, has many resources you can use to communicate with the developers
of this and other related projects.  If you subscribe to the mailing list, for example, you can ask questions your questions will be
